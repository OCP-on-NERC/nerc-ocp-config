                      pools describe a set of update pools. An update pool describes the update
                      behavior of selected core pods, for example how many pods can be updated in
                      parallel.

                            maxUnavailable defines either an integer number or percentage of core pods
                            and nodes in the pool that can go Unavailable during an update.
                            The default value is 1. A value larger than 1 will mean multiple core pods
                            and nodes going unavailable during the update, which causes that PV storage
                            of Storage Scale CSI is unavailable and may affect your workload stress on
                            the remaining nodes. You cannot set this value to 0 to stop updates;
                            to stop updates, use the 'paused' property instead.
                            This parameter must not be specified if the update pool references to an
